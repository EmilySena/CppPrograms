# CppPrograms
Hello, I'm Emily.
I have started a course of C++ in Udemy.
And I'm posting some of the programs that I wrote to practice.
Maybe it could be usefull for someone.
The programs are in enlgish because the course was in this language as well.
My IDE is CodeLite, but all the programs here can run in the command line or in other IDE too.
I tryed to do the best pratices, but it's not perfect yet, and I'm going to update it later with changes.
